# Biomes

This directory contains all biome configs, which defines all the biomes
contained within this pack.

# `colors.yml`

The `colors.yml` file assigns a unique color for each biome, for use in biome
distribution (for placement via image providers and visualization in dev tools).
This file also serves as a good list of all biomes in one place if you want to
see what biomes exist without sifting through the directory hierarchy.
